Based on the provided hackathon brief, here is a concise summary:

### **Core Objective:**
Design and build a **Loyalty Rewards Programme** for Mukuru, a financial services platform. The system should allow customers to earn, manage, and redeem points for sending remittances.

---

### **4 Key Requirements:**
1.  **Send:** Simulate sending a remittance. Make it engaging with an animation (e.g., money travelling across a map).
2.  **Earn:** Award loyalty points based on transaction value (e.g., 1 point per R100). Use creative visuals like coins, stars, or icons.
3.  **Manage:** Let users view their points balance and transaction history. Use visual elements like graphs or progress bars, not just basic lists.
4.  **Spend:** Create a Rewards Marketplace where users can browse and redeem points for rewards. Think fun and digital (e.g., stickers, airtime), not just physical items.

---

### **Bonus Features (if time allows):**
-   Gamification (tiers, achievement badges)
-   Leaderboard for top customers
-   A polished "shop" experience (browsing, cart, checkout)
-   Styling that aligns with Mukuru's brand identity

---

### **What You Need to Deliver:**
-   A working end-to-end prototype.
-   A backend API (manages points, balances, rewards).
-   A responsive frontend web app.
-   A 5-7 minute demo presentation.

---

### **How You Will Be Judged:**
-   **40% Functionality:** Does it work? Does it meet the core requirements?
-   **25% Creativity & UX:** Is it smooth, intuitive, fun, and on-brand?
-   **25% Technical Implementation:** Is the code well-structured with a clear frontend/backend separation?
-   **10% Presentation & Teamwork:** Was the demo clear and did the team work well together?

---

In short: **Build a fun, visually engaging, and functional loyalty app that makes sending money more rewarding.**
